'''
Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
